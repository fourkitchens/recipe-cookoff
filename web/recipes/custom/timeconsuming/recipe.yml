  # provided by the modules it configures. This allows them to not have
  # to maintain or copy this configuration.

  # Configuration actions may be defined. The structure here should be
  # configuration entity ID, action, and then action arguments. Below the user
  # role entity type with an ID of editor is being created if it does not exist
  # and then has permissions added. The permissions key will be mapped to the
  # \Drupal\user\Entity\Role::grantPermission() method.
