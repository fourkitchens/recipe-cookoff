# can be used by the UI to group Drupal recipes.
type: 'Cookoff'

install:
  # An array of modules or themes to install, if they are not already.
  # The system will detect if it is a theme or a module. During the
  # install only simple configuration from the new modules is created.
  # This allows the Drupal recipe control over the configuration.
  - konamicode

config:
  # A Drupal recipe can have a config directory. All configuration
  # is this directory will be imported after the modules have been
  # installed.

  # Additionally, the Drupal recipe can install configuration entities
  # provided by the modules it configures. This allows them to not have
  # to maintain or copy this configuration.
  import:

  # Configuration actions may be defined. The structure here should be
  # configuration entity ID, action, and then action arguments. Below the user
  # role entity type with an ID of editor is being created if it does not exist
  # and then has permissions added. The permissions key will be mapped to the
  # \Drupal\user\Entity\Role::grantPermission() method.
